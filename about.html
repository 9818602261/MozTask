<h1>About CU Firefox</h1>
<h3 id="h3">The Chandigarh University Firefox Club aims to teach the world, 
bring it online to an open web and start writing it just the way you want it. 
The Club hosts events to provide the knowledge and help every passionate person in contributing to the Mozilla Mission.
 Apart from hosting events, all the FSA's sit down and together work upon an idea,
 code it and then bring it live to the world using their developers account's. We also share knowledge and gain experience while working in the program.

<h1> Our Mission</h1>
<h3 id="h4">At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists,
 thinkers and builders working together to keep the Internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web.
 We believe this act of human collaboration across an open platform is essential to individual growth and our collective future.<h3>
 <h1>Career center</h1>
 <h3 id="h5">We are a proudly non-profit organization driven by a culture of openness and collaboration. 
 It’s a value we hold strong and it’s how we work together, day in and day out.When you join Mozilla,
 you’re becoming part of a global community that’s helping to build a brighter future for the Web — and for everyone. </h5>
 <h1> Mozilla Foundation</h1>
 <h3 id="h6">he nonprofit Mozilla Foundation is the organizational home of the Mozilla Project, a global community and public interest initiative that believes the Web should be open and accessible to all. To protect the Web as a public resource and empower its users, we create open source products, teach 21st-century skills and spur grassroots advocacy campaigns. All this is made possible by full-time staff and thousands of volunteers around the world.
To keep the Web accessible, we build products that create opportunity and inspire further innovation.
 Many of Mozilla’s products are developed by the Mozilla Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Mozilla Foundation.
 The Mozilla Corporation functions as a self-sustaining social enterprise — money earned through its products is reinvested into the organization.
 Products include our flagship Firefox browser, Firefox OS, and other open source tools.
 The Mozilla Corporation also partners with like-minded allies to bring an open source ethos to industries and technologies like online video,
 telecommunications and virtual reality. </h3>
